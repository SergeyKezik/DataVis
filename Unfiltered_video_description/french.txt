From November 14 to 17, 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his American counterpart Joe Biden and participated in the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco.
President Xi Jinping has many civilian friends in the United States and left many great stories. At the welcome dinner hosted by friendship organizations in the United States, he said: "The histories of China-US relations are written by their people."
After learning that President Xi was staying in the United States, students at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington, carefully prepared a painting for him and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The painting depicts elements of Chinese culture such as the panda and the memorial arch (pailou), and iconic elements of Washington state such as the groundhog and the Space Needle. It expresses the sincere wishes of teachers and students of Lincoln High School for lasting friendship between China and the United States. The painting also expresses the wish that the two nations create a radiant future together.
The friendship between Xi Jinping and Lincoln High School dates back to 1993.
Xi Jinping, then secretary of the CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee, visited Tacoma City and Lincoln High School.
On September 23, 2015, during his visit to the United States, President Xi Jinping visited Lincoln High School again, where he donated ping pong sports equipment to teachers and students. On occasion, he told the story of "the little ball leading to the big ball." During this visit, he surprised the students by inviting 100 students from Lincoln High School to visit China.
A year later, a delegation from Lincoln High School visited China. The delegation members saw the real China and brought back beautiful memories of China.
In 2021, Principal Patrick Erwen sent a letter to President Xi. Here is what he wrote: “In 2016, one hundred students from our school visited China at your invitation. It was the best educational experience of their lives. The miracle of China opened their eyes. We will set an example for the people of the two countries by strengthening student exchanges and educational cooperation. »
During this visit to the United States, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China is ready to invite 50,000 American teenagers to visit China for exchanges and studies in the next five years. This is to expand exchanges between the Chinese and American people, especially between younger generations. International reactions to the speeches that Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered at the APEC meetings in San Francisco are positive. Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center, shared his views. #APEC2023

The targeted site includes a UN school used as a shelter for displaced people. Multiple sources report a death toll of around 200 at the school. Israel has not yet commented on this matter. Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Iran condemned the attacks. They accused the Israeli army of violating international law and international humanitarian law and called for greater efforts to protect civilians in the Gaza Strip. US President Joe Biden indicated on Saturday that the Palestinian Authority will ultimately have to govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank after the war, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks to take control of Gaza. Since the conflict erupted on October 7, more than 12,300 people have been killed and more than 30,000 injured in Gaza. The Israeli death toll is around 1,200.

As Emmanuel Dupuy, professor and president of the Institute for Prospective and Security in Europe, explains, there are more areas of common ground between China and the United States than we think, and that is good news. for the entire world. #SpecialCorrespondents #APEC2023

Discover his “robot” portrait of our reporter O'scawn! “Just as Heaven is in constant evolution, the good man continually works towards its perfection". This quote embodies the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, which has strived for excellence since ancient times. Shenzhen quickly grew from a small fishing village to a cosmopolitan city, thanks to the hard work and innovation of countless builders. A young entrepreneur from Shenzhen put this profound maxim into practice and changed his life thanks to the rapid progress brought about by the city's reform and opening-up policy. What is the story of its success? Let’s find out together.  “We do not have to languish in our routine when we want to do things beneficial to the people, and we are not not required to follow the practices of yesteryear when you want something to be done well.” Thousands of years ago, the ancient Chinese explained the importance of reform for social development and improving people's well-being. This concept has been continued and developed in contemporary China. Located in the suburbs of Beijing, the village of Beilangzhong benefits neither from a privileged geographical location nor from enviable natural resources. There was a time when the development of Beilangzhong Village was hampered by a simple industrial structure. But thanks to the spirit of reform and innovation, Beilangzhong has now become a well-known industrial village, whose per capita disposable income exceeds 50,000 yuan. Since then, the villagers' daily lives have improved. What reform made it possible to increase income and diversify the sources of income of the rural population?

Tiktok:  I would like to present to you an exhibition that is causing a sensation in Beijing: “Hello, Sanxingdui! » An immersive exhibition of art and light.
Among the archaeological discoveries in China, Sanxingdui is undoubtedly one of the most mysterious. A hundred years ago, many artifacts and remains were discovered at the Sanxingdui site in Sichuan, most of them dating back more than three thousand years. Among them, there are fascinating jades, unique altars, enigmatic masks and half-human, half-bird statues. These artifacts reveal the creative genius of the inhabitants of the ancient Shu kingdom. Discover this astonishing civilization with me at the exhibition!

#LynnWithYou- In this new video, I take you to discover the specialty of the #Fujian province, Wan Gao (碗糕), literally “rice cake”. A dessert intended to celebrate the Spring Festival.

- This year, I am spending my New Year alone in Beijing like some of you. I hope you enjoy this little film, a video dedicated to all those who are spending their New Year away from home. ❤️

EASY RECIPE - Chinese rice cake 🍰✨
(As many have asked me, I summarize the steps below, with the precise preparation times. 😍 Hope you guys enjoy it!)
☞ Ingredients:
White sugar or brown sugar 80g
Water 150g
Rice powder 200g
Dehydrated baker's yeast 4g
Water 30g
☞ Preparation:
1. Put 80g of sugar in 150g of water and bring everything to the boil, then turn off the heat (so as not to lose too much water).
2. Pour the syrup into 200g of sifted rice powder, mix well until you obtain a homogeneous paste.
3. Dry the dough on a water bath for 3-4 minutes while whisking the mixture.
(Tip for checking if the consistency of the mixture is ideal: the dough should become smooth and homogeneous, and slide smoothly like a ribbon when dropped from height.)
4. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
5. Dilute 4g of yeast in 30g of water and let sit for 5 minutes.
☞ Fermentation:
Stir the yeast into the cooled dough. Cover the container with cling film and let the dough ferment for 1h30.
☞ Cooking:
When the dough has doubled its volume, stir again to remove the bubbles.
Pour everything into small containers (bowls, tart tins, etc.), steam for 25 minutes.
And there you have it, a little Chinese dessert is ready! I hope you like this recipe 😊 Don’t hesitate to ask me any questions in the comments, and of course, photos of the creation will always be welcome!

TWITTER ‣  conclusions can we draw from the meeting between the Chinese president and the American president? Zhang Shanhui interviewed Piet Steel, president of the Europe-Asia Center and former Belgian ambassador to Vietnam. The latter considers that this meeting between the two heads of state is excellent news, not only for the two countries concerned, but also for the entire world.【APEC 2023】 Relations between China and the United States appear tense, complex, and it seems that the world is still on the brink of a second Cold War. But this vision does not necessarily correspond to reality. The world's two largest economic powers, as Zhang Shanhui demonstrates here, have been cooperating for years on crucial issues that benefit all of humanity. And while there has been and always will be friction, both countries seem determined to continue their partnership and even deepen it. The fate of the world depends on it and the United States must decide the right course of action. Since the election of Xi Jinping as head of the world's second largest economy, the United States has focused its attention on what it considered a rival: China. But as Zhang Shanhui explains in reviewing a decade of ties between the two countries, while China has always advocated peaceful balance between the two countries, the United States has instead sought to ruin it. By responding to Joe Biden's invitation to participate in APEC 2023, Xi Jinping demonstrates that blind rivalry has no place and that it is essential to reestablish a balanced and peaceful dialogue that will benefit the people of both powers . Decryption with Zhang ShanhuiThe presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping from November 14 to 17 at the 30th informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in San Francisco is a symbol and a clear message sent to the international community. China is reaching out to the United States, which is seeking to renew dialogue; but she intends to ensure that Joe Biden respects the fundamental principle of mutual respect so that the two countries get on the right path. Decryption with Zhang Shanhui. It was in 2020 that the IOC added 4 new events to the 2024 Olympics: breakdancing, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing. In general, the tests making theirs debut at the Olympics appears in the previous Asian Games which begins on September 23 in Hangzhou! In this episode “We battles?” yes battles! ", join Zhang Shanhui, host of CGTN Français, Jade Charles, Bouboo Soumaré, French hip-hop dancer who currently lives in China, Abdel Mustapha, coach and coordinator of the French breakdance team and Bgril Sissy, member of the French breakdance team, to feel the passion of breaking! It was a great honor to host the 2023 Global Talent Sustainable Development Forum at the China International Fair for Trade in Services(#CIFTIS) on September 6. The whole day's forum welcomed more than 30 guests who shared their insights. The forum involved discussions around education, international cooperation, and sustainable development goals(#SDGs): what kind of international talent is needed in today's society? How to build a sustainable talent training mechanism? How to better empower women in their education and career development? How do different cultures and educational concepts influence each other in cooperation between China and other countries around the world? What are the possibilities for educational cooperation among developing countries and developed countries? Let us work together to realize Sustainable Development Goals!@CenterforChinaandGlobalization@unwomenThe visit of the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo to China crowns 51 years of fruitful relations and cooperation in many areas. With Patrick Muyaya Katembwe, Minister of Communication and Media of the DRC, Zhang Shanhui discusses the media links uniting the two countries. Mr. Muyaya affirms that young Congolese have a real thirst to learn about China, its rich history, its evolution and what it can bring to the African continent.

- First broadcast 05/26/2023Exclusive interview of Zhang Shanhui with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Benin, Olushegun ADJADI BAKARI, and Alimatou Shadiya ASSOUMAN, Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Republic of Benin at the Embassy of Benin in China. The two Beninese ministers participated in the 5th session of the Joint Economic, Commercial and Technical Commission as well as the Sino-African Economic and Trade Exhibition in Changsha, Hunan. We took stock of the cooperation between the two countries for 51 years. In the interview, they discuss the results of their visit to China and the evolution of the Sino-Beninese relationship over the next 5 years. In addition, from cooperation in infrastructure and trade in raw products such as soybeans, chili peppers, cotton and cashew nuts, Benin wishes to attract more high value-added Chinese investments. #french #journalist #invest #africa #commerce #economyThe 29th edition of the Beijing International Book Fair is underway, Algeria is participating as an honored guest countryur. On this occasion, a series of Sino-Arab activities are organized. On site, Zhang Shanhui introduces you to the meeting of the two cultures. Organized on the sidelines of the French presidential visit, the 5th meeting of the Franco-Chinese business council is an opportunity for large French companies to sign very important contracts in China. It also shows to what extent, after 3 years of health crisis, business leaders are impatient to strengthen already very strong links of cooperation in a country whose market development opportunities are endless. Zhang Shanhui collected the impressions of those responsible for French flagships such as L'Oréal, Michelin and Club Med at the Grand Palais du Peuple, and they did not hide their enthusiasm. 【中法企业家委员会第五次会议在北京召开】欧莱雅集团董事会主席安巩、米其林集团董事长兼首席执行官孟立国、赛峰集团董事长麦克尼斯、法国畜牧及肉类协会外贸委员会主席比戈尔等多位嘉宾在现场表达了对中法进一步加强合作的期待， The visit of the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo to China is an opportunity to take stock of 5 1 year of partnership, cooperation , unwavering support and friendship. It is also, as its Minister of Foreign Affairs Christophe Lutunda Apala explains to Zhang Shanhui, the moment to open a new era of relations between two countries which resemble and complement each other. The DRC adheres to the Chinese project of a community with a shared future intended to build a safer, more just world focused on respect for each other with the sole aim of the well-being and prosperity of the people. The government activity report Chinese government with an economic growth target of 5% in 2023 was submitted to NPC deputies during the Two Sessions currently taking place in Beijing. But how to understand this figure? Zhang Shanhui deciphers for us what is hidden behind this 5% growth and gives us his vision of Chinese economic development for the years to come. In this second edition of My Beijing Express with Shanhui, let's take the pulse of the Chinese economy. Chinese film industry: direction, production, distribution, box office and derivative products. We will also ask the question of the prospects for opportunities in the future. Our guests: Zou Lu, deputy general director of distribution at Star Times; Mustafa Ozgun, French director; Noël Garino, artistic and technical delegate of the Chinese Cinema Festival in France and Zhang Huimin, French interpreter of the preparatory team for “The Wandering Earth II” Living conditions in rural areas have improved considerably in recent decades in China. This has led to new consumption and production habits but above all a jump in investments allowing the development of much better quality products in less painful and safer conditions. The Chinese do not intend to keep the keys to this success for themselves, but as Zhang Shanh explainsui at Golfe TV Bénin, they aim to support African farmers in the transformation of production methods for better yields and better income. “The My Beijing Express Forum with Shanhui” is your new weekly meeting devoted to Chinese news. With his guests, Shanhui Zhang deciphers the latest economic figures, political and diplomatic developments, new trends in all areas with rigor, seriousness, but also an essential touch of good humor. This first issue is dedicated to the opportunities for SMEs to develop in China after the relaxation of health measures which have considerably boosted the country's economic growth. #KickStart2023The visit of the Chinese Foreign Minister is a hot topic. Embarking on a new journey, China is ready to work together with Africa to deepen mutual exchanges and Sino-African cooperation. What proposal on the development of China-Africa relations has been put forward? What could be done in the future on this “grand stage for international cooperation”? Decryption in the meeting of our presenter Zhang Shanhui with Ambassador Ali El Hefni, former Egyptian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Yahia Zoubir, senior professor in international studies and research director in geopolitics at KEDGE Business School, and Dr. Yu Jia, professor at the Institute of New Structural Economics at Beijing University.Innovation, innovation and innovation!

Although redeveloped, this street retains all its atmosphere and charm. It has become a must-see tourist spot in Hangzhou.
