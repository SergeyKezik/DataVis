Chinese President Xi Jinping recently held a China-U.S. Presidential Meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the Fillory Estate in San Francisco, the United States, which attracted great attention from the international community. Gao Fei, deputy dean of the China Foreign Affairs University, recently accepted an exclusive interview with China News Service's "China Focus Face to Face". When talking about the areas and prospects of future cooperation between China and the United States, Gao Fei pointed out that as global powers, China and the United States are very important in solving global challenges. Bearing great responsibilities, many global issues cannot be effectively resolved without cooperation between the two countries. On the other hand, the two sides can find a new basis for cooperation by strengthening cooperation in the field of global governance and solving hot issues and global challenges of common concern.

Gao Fei particularly noticed that the meeting between the two heads of state specifically mentioned that the two sides should cooperate in the field of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a typical representative of the new technological revolution. It will not only bring about huge improvements in productivity, but there are also many ethical issues behind the new technology. How to make relevant technologies develop in the right direction that people want requires cooperation and coordination between the two countries.

Gao Fei believes that in addition to the traditional security field, there are also many hot spots in the traditional security field in the world. If China and the United States have a consensus on solving these hot-spot issues, I think we will definitely find a way to solve them. The most important thing is that everyone can sit down, talk, and find more consensus. Subscribe to the channel and get more exciting content:

From Bali to San Francisco, President Xi Jinping mentioned China's position on the Taiwan issue in meetings. Recently, Gao Fei, deputy dean of the China Foreign Affairs University, said in an exclusive interview with China News Service's "China Focus Face to Face" that the Taiwan issue is the most important issue in Sino-US relations. It is the core of China's core interests and has no room for maneuver. .

In November 2021, during the video call between the heads of state of China and the United States, Biden already stated that he would not support "Taiwan independence." Biden has since continued to repeat relevant policy statements and also emphasized that the United States pursues a one-China policy.

Chinese President Xi Jinping recently held a China-U.S. Presidential Meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the Fillory Estate in San Francisco, the United States, which attracted great attention from the international community. Gao Fei, deputy dean of the China Foreign Affairs University, recently accepted an exclusive interview with China News Service's "China Focus Face to Face". When talking about the areas and prospects of future cooperation between China and the United States, Gao Fei pointed out that as global powers, China and the United States are very important in solving global challenges. Bearing great responsibilities, many global issues cannot be effectively resolved without cooperation between the two countries. On the other hand, the two sides can find a new basis for cooperation by strengthening cooperation in the field of global governance and solving hot issues and global challenges of common concern.

Gao Fei particularly noticed that the meeting between the two heads of state specifically mentioned that the two sides should cooperate in the field of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a typical representative of the new technological revolution. It will not only bring about huge improvements in productivity, but there are also many ethical issues behind the new technology. How to make relevant technologies develop in the right direction that people want requires cooperation and coordination between the two countries.

Gao Fei believes that in addition to the traditional security field, there are also many hot spots in the traditional security field in the world. If China and the United States have a consensus on solving these hot-spot issues, I think we will definitely find a way to solve them. The most important thing is that everyone can sit down, talk, and find more consensus. Subscribe to the channel and get more exciting content:

Ancient China was a farming civilization. Since the straw planted was not enough to burn for a whole year, and going up the mountain to chop firewood required a lot of physical effort, it was not easy to obtain firewood and oil. Ancient chefs cherished heat. In order to cook food better and faster, they wrapped as many different ingredients as possible and stewed them together, such as dumplings, glutinous rice balls, and lotus.Fragrant glutinous rice chicken...this "containment" and "wrapping" gradually formed one of the unique Chinese food cultures. Hong Kong chef Li Mengchang followed this idea and created a new Chinese dish - steamed "Eight Treasure Star Spot" based on the traditional Babao Duck. Different from the previous preparation methods of Babao duck and other Chinese dishes, the meat of star spot is smooth and glutinous, and it is extremely difficult to keep fresh. Strict control of time is required for carving and steaming the fish.

This June, with the launch of its new aircraft carrier, the Fujian, the Chinese navy now has three. The vessel is the first in the fleet to be equipped with an electromagnetic catapult and can send off shipboard aircraft in rapid succession. These days, the Fujian has been conducting a series of equipment installation and debugging, while furthering the relevant test missions.
"Today's progress in building China's aircraft carrier fleet would not be possible without the endeavor of the entire country. In just 10 years, we have achieved the goal of the Liaoning aircraft carrier fleet navigating in the sea with combat capacity greatly improved and explored an aircraft carrier development path with Chinese characteristics," said Ma Chao, head of the air support department of the aircraft carrier Fujian.

Carrier-based aircraft have also been playing a vital part in the Chinese navy.

In 2017, the carrier-based air force successfully took off and landed at night on the aircraft carrier Liaoning for the first time.

"The breakthrough in nighttime techniques and the mastery of nighttime landing means we are capable of performing tasks in an all-weather manner, particularly at night and in complicated weather conditions. With all-weather combat advantages, we will have greater initiative in future wars," said Xu Ying, deputy captain of aircraft carrier Shandong.

Batches after batches of carrier-based aircraft have taken risks to go through trainings such as nighttime aerial refueling, sea ultra-low-altitude defense penetration and carrier-based air-sea fighting in the past decade, so as to improve the combat capacity of the aircraft carrier fleet.

"In recent years, our aircraft carriers have achieved leapfrog development. It's safe to saythe development path with Chinese characteristics has been tested with actual results. Now, the range of missions of the domestically-made aircraft carrier Shandong is also constantly expanding as it rapidly develops. Our first carrier that uses catapults, the Fujian, is also accumulating strength. We believe that in the near future, the three aircraft carriers will show our strong power at broader international stage," said Cui Yonggang, captain of the Liaoning.

Phoenix · Li Miao's Japan Observation  He calls himself the godmother of contemporary rock, puts on his own makeup, and sings "I Man" rock with Northeastern characteristics "E Man".
He feels that "cool" equates to real rock and roll, and rock and roll that doesn't cry or laugh, and doesn't eat the fireworks of the world and "pretend to be a fairy" is ineffective.
Once upon a time, Diplodocus also thought seriously about why fans didn't listen to his lyrics, and his music was only regarded as a kind of crazy relaxation. Now he has a new definition of his music: It’s good if it can bring everyone happiness.
Liang Long once used eight words to define himself as "playing life and having fun".
This time he added two more sentences: Life is short, it must be sexy.
"Extraordinary Tao" takes you into: second-hand roses, first-hand Diplodocus
