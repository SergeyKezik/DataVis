I invited my Chinese friend to try fasting for the first time in her life, and of course for only one full day. After this experience, she said that she wanted to fast.
 For a week in the future

There are The Arab countries have many distinct products that the Chinese like very much. Do you know what Arab products we prefer to buy and carry to China? We are interviewing several Chinese people who have visited Arab countries. Let us hear their answers. It pains us greatly what the people of Gaza and Palestine are going through these days.
From our position here, we stand on the side of peace and address the conscience of humanity
Where I, along with some Chinese youth, recited excerpts from the poems of the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish
To call for peace: If you have 10 US dollars, what can you buy in China with this amount?🧐
You won't believe that for only $10 you can get...Behind a lot of things!!!
The question here: Why are Chinese products so cheap?
#China #MadeInChina
#ChinaArabStatesExpo
#Question_about_China With China's growing economic power, some believe that China today is a developed country, but is China really strong enough to become a "developed country"?
There are several reasons why China insists on its status as a developing country:
⭕️ China's per capita GDP and gross national income are low
⭕️ China still suffers from unbalanced development and the gap between urban and rural areas and between East and West
⭕️ In the field of manufacturing, there is still a lot of room for improvement in high-end manufacturing and technological innovation
...The heat wave is hitting the Chinese capital, Beijing, this summer. The temperature has exceeded 40 degrees Celsius five times so far, which is an unprecedented level..
High temperatures, drought, forest fires, heavy rains and floods... extreme weather is becoming more common in the world.
We conducted interviews with a group of Arab and Chinese young people to talk about the topic of “climate change.”
What climate change phenomena have occurred around you? Leave comments and tell us.. The 29th Beijing International Book Fair will be held from June 15 to 18 in Beijing, and Algeria participated as the guest of honor in the exhibition with 800 types of Arabic books.. Why has the Chinese language become more popular in Arab countries, especially in Egypt? ! Let us listen to the voices of Egyptians who excel in the Chinese language...with us
 Dr.. Hassan Ragab, Director of the Confucius Institute and Dean of the Faculty of Al-Alsun at Suez Canal University
Sayed Wael Abdel Hamid, director of the Chinese language teaching program for the Nile Educational Channel
Malak Walid is the winner of the final “Chinese Language Bridge” competition for Egypt
Thanks for sharing everyone. Happy Friday~
How to learn Chinese? My Arab friends always ask me about this question.. Today I present to you some wonderful sites and programs. I hope they will be useful to you. Ramadan Mubarak 🌙💛
I spent the first day of Ramadan with my beloved Arab friends!!
It's a beautiful time. The Kobuchi Desert, the seventh largest desert in China and the closest desert to Beijing, was a major source of sandstorms in Beijing, but now it supplies Beijing with clean electricity without interruption.

In the Kobuchi Desert, there are many solar power plants, but under the solar panels there is a magical sight. Farmers grow corn, herbs, and raise earthworms under the shade of the panels, and around them, farmers also raise chickens, ducks, sheep, and even grow rice in the desert.

The solar power plant can generate clean electricity, and it can combat desertification and increase farmers' income. How can this be achieved? Red clothes, red lanterns, red decorations... In China everyone loves the color red, especially during the holidays!! Do you know the reason? The Egyptian pyramids, the Emirati Burj Khalifa, and other Arab landmarks are illuminated in red.. What is the reason?🧐
Red is the color of the Chinese flag 🇨🇳, and the favorite color of the Chinese people during the holidays. With the advent of the Chinese Spring Festival, the Chinese immerse themselves in the sea of ​​red decorations. Thank you to our Arab friends for celebrating with us... Arab products that you bought all in China?! Do you want to know what the products are? Come and watch the video... The full moon symbolizes completion, reunion, blessing, and happiness in Chinese culture, and the moon is a symbol of beauty among the Arabs as well, as it is the only light in the dark sky, and moonlit nights were considered the most suitable nights for travel, staying up late, or love. Today is the Moon Festival, or we call it the Mid-Autumn Festival.Salma and I read an Arabic poem about the moon for you, called (Ahla Khabar), by the poet Nizar Qabbani, to express flirtation and love.... With my friend Salma, I visited the “Mesopotamia Encounter” exhibition held in Beijing. We were fascinated by the ancient civilizations that existed in the lands of the countries. Arabic.. Although we are from different countries, civilizations have no borders. They are precious treasures for all of humanity. Do you agree with that? An art exhibition under the title “Sustainability” held in Beijing, showing how to transform waste into something useful. My friend Salma and I visited it. 🌄🌄Debris of the final stage of China's Long March-5BY3 carrier rocket re-entered the atmosphere at approximately 0:55 on July 31, 2022 Beijing time, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
The vast majority of the missile burned up during its re-entry into the atmosphere as the debris fell into the sea, and the center of the landing zone was at 119 degrees east longitude and 9.1 degrees north latitude, according to the agency. Anna Muyi is a Chinese journalist, who has visited several deserts in China these years to cover. And I saw the green miracle with my own eyes. I hope to transfer the Chinese experiences in combating desertification to you, so that every country suffering from desertification can benefit from them. In recent days, the Beijing municipality has arranged some residential communities in high- and medium-risk areas for temporary closed management to deal with Covid-19. I live in one of these residential communities, which means I cannot leave this area. What are the living conditions of residents in the temporary closed administration? I made this video to show you my life these days. One of our days in Haikou City
May God make the days of the honorable people of the entire earth happy. After the military conflicts occurred in the Gaza Strip, China expressed its position regarding this conflict and the Palestinian issue. China stressed that the highest priority is an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians, the opening of humanitarian corridors, and adherence to international law, especially international humanitarian law, and the only way out is the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent State of Palestine. China stands on the side of peace and justice, and supports the just struggle of the Palestinian people. #Gaza What is China’s position on the Taiwanese authorities’ efforts to develop offensive weapons? Is this beneficial to the situation on the Taiwan Strait? Here are the details in my intervention on Cairo News Channel. The cooperation mechanism between China, South Korea and Japan was launched in 1999, and over the course of more than 20 years, 8 tripartite summits and nine tripartite meetings were held between foreign ministers, which contributed to cooperation and achieving common interests between these three countries. Since 2019, the tripartite cooperation mechanism between these three countries has been suspended due to the Corona pandemic and the geopolitical situation in the Northeast Asia region. What is the importance of resuming this tripartite cooperation mechanism? What is China's position regarding its cooperation with South Korea and Japan? Here are my opinions through my intervention on BBC Arabic. #China #South_Korea #Japan #BBC_Arabic Chinese Premier Li Qiang attends the G20 summit held in India. What message is China sending through the presence of its Prime Minister at this summit? Let's follow my talk on the topic. #G20India2023 #Absence_of_the_Chinese_President_from_G20 Chinese Premier Li Qiang attends the G20 summit held in India. The absence of Chinese President Xi from this summit has raised widespread concerns about what messages China is sending through the presence of its Prime Minister at this summit. #G20India2023 #Absence_of_the_Chinese_President_from_G20 Regarding the disputes between China and the Philippines in the islands in the South China Sea, China confirmed that it has sovereigntyThere is no controversy on these islands and nearby waters in the South China Sea. What is China's position on this matter? Here are the details about it through my intervention on Al Arabiya channel #AlArabiya #SouthChinaSea What are the measures taken by China to confront the expected disasters from Hurricane Sola? Intervention on Al Arabiya channel #AlArabiya #China #Hurricane What is the impact of Hurricane Sola on the coastal areas of southeastern China? Here are the details from my intervention on #AlArabiya channel. There is a fundamental difference between the nuclear-contaminated water that came into direct contact with the molten core of the reactor during the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the water released by nuclear power plants in normal operations. They differ in nature, come from two different sources, and require different levels of complexity. In treating each of them. Just as the IAEA report is not comprehensive and has international legal effect or validity, it cannot provide any legitimacy or justification for Japan's irresponsible actions. #China #Japan China opposes and condemns Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, describing it as a selfish and irresponsible act. I asked the Japanese government to stop this mistake. #Nuclear_polluted_water #Japan #China Cooperation between the BRICS countries is characterized by tolerance and non-confrontation, and the BRICS countries take an open stance towards enhancing their cooperation with other countries, especially emerging economies and developing countries, as well as relevant international and regional organizations. And it is not in order to provoke confrontation between different countries.#BRICS #BRICS_Cooperation The BRICS countries have established the New Development Bank, which aims to finance many development projects and is always considered a potential alternative to the World Bank. How does the bank contribute to building the new economic system and helping the BRICS countries achieve economic development? Here are the details from my intervention on Algeria International Channel. #BRICS The BRICS group aims to improve global governance, ensure multilateralism, and advance the democratization of international relations, in order to advance global peace and development. How do you work to protect a multipolar system on a global scale? Here is my intervention on Algeria International Channel. #BRICS_Africa The three statements issued by the summit included topics related to the issue of Taiwan and the South China Sea, which is considered a strict interference in Chinese internal affairs. China has always been committed to achieving complete national reunification through a peaceful manner, and has expressed the greatest sincerity in this regard. But it will not accept the interference of external forces in its internal affairs, especially in the issue of Taiwan, which is considered one of China's core interests. China's military maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait have demonstrated its resolve, strength and capabilities in protecting its integrity and national sovereignty. #China #Maneuvers #taiwan #TaiwanQuestion The Asia-Pacific region needs development and peace, and should not become a battleground for cold or hot wars. As the countries of the region enjoy great economic integration, and cooperation between them is witnessing continuous strengthening, promoting security concerns in the region, and forming a small circle to provoke confrontation, cannot harm the interests of the countries of the region, rather it will harm peace and stability there. #CampDavid_Summit The Renai Reef area has “always been part of China’s Nansha Islands” in the South China Sea. What happened between China and the Philippines in this region? Here are the details from my intervention on Cairo News Channel. Regarding the United States supplying its weapons to the Chinese Taiwan region, China reaffirmed its position. Why do you oppose China?Military contacts between the United States and the Taiwan Authority? What is the goal of the American side in doing so? Here are the details. Under the influence of Typhoon Doxuri, continuous heavy rain fell on some Chinese regions, including the city of Beijing and Hebei Province, which is located next to Beijing, resulting in heavy losses in these areas. In the city of Beijing, since last July 29, with particularly severe rainstorms hitting the parts located in the west, southwest and south of the city, killing 11 people.
Here are the details about this heavy rain. I wish everyone safety in this severe disaster. 🙏China has been working on developing artificial intelligence in recent years, and has achieved fruitful results. Currently, China has become one of the leading countries in this field worldwide. Is this an excuse to make the United States worry about him? Is there competition between the two countries in the field of artificial intelligence? What is the difference between China and the United States in the development of the trend of artificial intelligence? Here are the details from my intervention on #Sky_News_Arabia channel #Artificial_Intelligence #China #United_States The “Ocus” alliance was launched in 2021, and includes the United States, Britain, and Australia. Will this alliance contribute to ensuring regional peace or lead to an arms competition in Asia and the Pacific?
