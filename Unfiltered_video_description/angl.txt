In Lhasa, I explored the most renowned Barkhor Street, a bustling marketplace that truly embodies the vibrant Tibetan culture. From colorful stalls selling beautiful crafts, prayer flags fluttering in the breeze, to the mouthwatering aroma of local delicacies, it was an assault on the senses in the best possible way.

How to make changes through global cooperation?
What can we do?I found that many adjustments made in this year's Two Sessions are related to the ecological environment! For example, the CPPCC added a new sector for the first time in 30 years — the environment resource sector, and it suddenly became the sector with the largest number of members, with 85 members! The institutional reform of the State Council also transferred the work of ecological technology from the Ministry of Science and Technology to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The government work report mentions "ecology", "environment" and "green" in many places. I interviewed a few deputies of the National People's Congress in the field of ecology, and routinely asked "what motions did you bring?" I found that each deputy was paying attention to legislation in different ecological segments... That was a surprise.The costumes of ethnic minorities are so pretty. They always are the highlights at the Great Hall of the People!It's International Women’s Day! 
For female deputies attending the Two Sessions, they're going to celebrate at the Great Hall of the People. It is also my third time celebrating the day in the Hall. Of the 2,977 deputies in total this year, 790 are women, up 1.64% over last year, making the she-power stronger.I visited the Ancient Ecological Park in Xinjiang. The park is famed for rearing rare species of horses, and is the largest exhibit base for the much-coveted Akhal-Teke horses, known for their speed and endurance.

Prescriptions can be made online and drugs are delivered offline, and that has eased the pressure on medical resources, and avoided crowds in hospitals to reduce the risk of cross-infections.Ecological conservation has become a much more popular topic in China's top two political parties in recent years. The amount of related motions and proposals has increased significantly. Ahead of the opening of the Two Sessions this year, I invited Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz, professor and principal investigator of the Megafauna Ecology and Conservation group at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, as well as Li Yuhan, team leader of the Yangtze Delta Region Office at Shan Shui Conservation Center, to talk about the human-wildlife coexistence in China and their expectations towards the Two Sessions.Thangka, a gem of Tibetan culture, is a Buddhist painting that typically visualizes deities on canvas, cotton or silk with pigments extracted from ore. Dating back to the Tibetan Tubo Kingdom around 1,200 years ago, the sacred art of such religious painting has been passed down the generations.

Although the art form has evolved over the years into several schools of painting, Tibetan Thangka artists, by rigorously adhering to the traditional guidelines, continue to draw the roadmap to enlightenment. Divine beings, treasure vase, lotus flower … all the elements are brought to life with the strokes of fine brushes. Join CGTN reporter Yang Xinmeng for an introduction to Tibetan Thangka painting and explore the region through art.Go to @cgtnamerica on YouTube to see all of our videos:   Asia America's Philip Yin is joined by Paul Bledsoe, President of Bledsoe & Associates to discuss how successful are China's efforts to shut down factories to reduce air pollution.

The 'Azzurri' host North Macedonia at the Stadio Olimpico, a fixture that could revive bad memories for the Italians.

Last year Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup for the second consecutive time after losing to North Macedonia 0-1 in a playoff semi-final played in Palermo.

“Only that result (the victory) counts, then from tomorrow night we will think about other things, but that's what we want to do now”, said Italy’s coach Luciano Spalletti.

For Luciano Spalletti the match will mark an emotional return to the Stadio Olimpico, the stadium of As Roma that Spalletti coached from 2005 to 2009 and again in the 2016/2017 season

Friday's match will be the appetiser for the decisive match against Ukraine on Monday.

Ukraine will host Italy in Germany - at the stadium of Bundesliga leader Bayer Leverkusen - because they cannot play international games at home for security reasons during the military invasion by Russia.

Italy trail Ukraine by three pointss but with a game in hand, and a win on Friday against North Macedonia would make even a draw against Ukraine enough to qualify for Euro 2024.Trent Alexander-Arnold admits he has a "newfound excitement" for international football since reverting to a midfield role with England.

Despite a host of eye-catching appearances at right-back for Liverpool as they won the Premier League and Champions League, Alexander-Arnold found his pathway to the England side blocked by strong competition in the shape of Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier and Reece James.

He excelled in a midfield role in the 4-0 Euro 2024 qualifying win in Malta last season and is expected to play in a similar role in the reverse fixture at Wembley on Friday night.Video via ©UEFA 2023

Luciano Spalletti’s Italy stepped out at the National Training Centre at Coverciano in Florence on Thursday, on the eve of their penultimate Euro 2024 qualification Group C match against North Macedonia.

The ‘Azzurri’ need a strong finish if they are to secure the second automatic ticket to next year's finals in Germany behind England.

The defending European champions need to beat Friday’s guests at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome and then avoid defeat against Ukraine in Leverkusen on Monday to reach their goal.

That could prove trickier than it might appear on paper - Italy fans are still haunted by the humiliating 1-0 defeat by North Macedonia in Palermo just last year, a result that meant they missed out on a place at the 2022 World Cup finals.

And in the reverse Euro 2024 Group C fixture against the same opposition in Skopje on 9th September, they could only draw 1-1.

Spalletti has also had deal with a series of injuries and suspensions in the build-up to these crucial matches.

However, Italy will still start as favourites against North Macedonia and due to their 2-1 win over Ukraine at the San Siro on 12th September, they have the head-to-head edge over the blue and yellows as well.North Macedonian boss Blagoja Milevski team said that his team did not come to Rome to be tourists, on the eve of the match against Italy in the Euro 2024 qualification.

The 'Azzurri' must seek victory against North Macedonia before facing Monday a high-stakes game against Ukraine, likely for second place behind England in Group C.

The process of creating Yutuo involves covering the outline of a fish on paper, sprinkling ink or pigment over it, and then gently pressing paper or fabric onto the surface of the fish to capture its texture and shape. The uniqueness of this technique lies in its combination of the beautiful textures of the natural world with artistic expression, resulting in a distinctive visual effect.

TikTok:  history is marked by myriad conflicts and wars. From ancient times to the present day, wars have mainly been fought over territory, religion, ideology, resources, and power. The consequences have been devastating, with countless lives lost, families torn apart, and communities destroyed. Wars have left deep scars on societies and individuals, and the memories of past wars continue to shape the present. While war is an indelible part of human history, the pursuit of peace should forever be the ultimate goal.

For this episode of Jessica StreetTV, we collected voices from #iraq , #afghanistan , and #syria  to know more about wars' lingering effects.

TikTok:  Kail, also known as @PawnMan is a Minnesota pawnshop owner and TikTok creator. Earlier this autumn, he posted videos based on an album of photos taken during Imperial Japanese Army massacres in China during World War II. Kail’s videos went viral, garnering over 51.6 million views on TikTok. This led to threats against him and his business, and he has worn a bulletproof vest ever since.

TikTok:  is literally a breathtaking video. 

At an altitude of 4,800 meters, where the air contains just about 60% of the oxygen found at lower altitudes, every step we took left us breathless. 

In recent times, Western media outlets have been filled with alarming reports accusing China of forcibly enrolling one million Tibetan children into boarding schools as part of a broader strategy aimed at cultural assimilation. This narrative made headlines and even led to the United States issuing new sanctions against China. 

But what is the reality? We embarked on an investigative journey to uncover the truth about Tibetan boarding schools and their impact on Tibetan culture and students' lives. 

Join us in unveiling the facts and spreading the truth. 

#china #tibet #boardingschool #usa #school #language #cultureWestern media has criticized China's development efforts in Tibet as 'environmental destruction,' with even tree planting being branded as 'greenwashing.' However, as we investigate regional environmental projects and engage with local residents and officials, we find that China's ecological efforts have helped to curb sandstorms, promote local tourism development, and enhance the living conditions for locals. 'Our environment may not be the best for living, but we have the means, which is why we aim to improve it.' Local officials explained their philosophy, stating, 'You cannot keep the poor forever poor and the rich forever rich.'

#china #tibet #ecologyChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Wednesday that China did not issue any law, regulation or policy document that bans the purchase and use of cellphones of foreign brands, such as iPhone. However, she also noted some media reports about security issues related to iPhone.

Apple recently unveiled its latest iPhone 15 series, featuring a few design changes that left some consumers underwhelmed and vowing not to upgrade. This launch coincided with Huawei's introduction of the MATE 60 Pro and the portable phone X5. We interviewed Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, and asked him to compare the new Huawei phones with the iPhone 15 series. He told us that while Huawei's new phone might not impact Apple's global market, there is a higher likelihood of it influencing the Chinese market.

The question on everyone's mind is whether Huawei's remarkable technological advancements might circumvent the sanctions imposed by the United States. He said these sanctions primarily revolve around national security concerns, and bypassing them entirely remains a complex challenge.Japan's recent release of nuclear-contaminated wastewater into the ocean sparked a wave of information and disinformation.Western media downplayed concerns but quickly labeled China's response as "retaliation." Even a social media post explaining the differences between Japan's contaminated wastewater and wastewater released from a standard nuclear power plant got called "Chinese disinformation".

The West's defense of Japan's actions sheds light on its own historical disposal of 200,000+ tons of nuclear waste into the oceans. Yet this still left out the suffering of Native Americans and Pacific Islanders from US nuclear tests. #japan #usa #history #nuclear #weapons #pollution #chinaJapan's controversial decision to release radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the ocean has sparked heated debates among Chinese consumers. In this episode, we venture into Japanese restaurants in Beijing and engage with local residents to uncover their concerns. 

Many express their reservations, vowing to steer clear of Japanese cosmetics products and seafood due to fears surrounding the wastewater release. Join us as we delve into the growing food safety and cosmetic anxieties in China and its impact on Japan-China relations in the wake of this environmental issue. #japan #fukushima #nuclear #china #cosmetics #foodIn this thought-provoking interview, we dive deep into the complexities of US-China relations, exploring the perplexing juxtaposition of US high-tech bans and extensive trade with China. Join us as we sit down with Yan Xuetong, a prominent political thinker in China, to gain insights into the policies and motivations behind these actions.

The Biden administration has avoided using the term "containment," but Professor Yan argues that the direction of their policies is aimed at limiting China's global cooperation, particularly in high-tech sectors like chips and digital technology. Yan Xuetong reveals the US's ambition for a China that is economically prosperous but militarily weak.

Looking to the future, Yan emphasizes the importance of focusing on domestic policies for China's growth and strength. He believes that a country's true strength lies in its domestic policies, highlighting the need for boosting domestic consumption, improving investment conditions, and enhancing scientific and technological research and development capabilities.

#china #usa #trade #chips"China is bad in everything," wrote James Crickton for ANI. But what if we told you that James Crickton and many other so-called experts and think tanks don't even exist? Our investigation has uncovered shocking revelations about ANI's reliance on non-existent experts to shape their news.

We reached out to these experts and their research institutions, but our efforts proved futile. The think tank, The POREG, answered our phone call promising to send us more information about the experts, but despite multiple attempts, we haven't received any response from them.

The US-India relationship has entered a peculiar honeymoon period, with the US seeking India's help in containing China. However, what the Americans may not be ready for is becoming victims of pro-India disinformation campaigns. #india #china #usa #fake #europe"Before there was Fu Xiangdong, and now there is Chen Zhoufeng." The list of victims under the US persecution of Chinese scientists keeps growing, even after the official proclamation of the end of the China Initiative.

The "China Initiative" operation has gone underground. In this episode, we examine the stories of Chinese scientists Fu Xiangdong at UC San Diego, Chen Zhoufeng at Washington University, and Lin Haifan at Yale. We uncover the racist campaign launched by NIH, which nearly cost them their careers and led to an increasing distrust in scientific exchanges between the two countries.

#NIH #CIA #Yale #FBI #US #China #science #Racism #Secret #Washington #usa #americaIt has been a decade since Edward Snowden's shocking revelations reverberated around the globe, shedding light on the extensive surveillance activities conducted by the United States. 

However, rather than witnessing a rollback of these practices, the American surveillance empire has stealthily expanded its reach. Military manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems have now entered the fray of the cyber military industrial complex, aiding in the implementation of surveillance projects for the US government, all in the pursuit of higher profits. 

Join us as we delve into this alarming phenomenon, uncovering the hidden connections and consequences.

Sevim Dağdelen, a member of the German Bundestag, joins us for an exclusive interview to discuss the Ukraine conflict, US provocations regarding Taiwan, and the differing perspectives on human rights between China and Western countries.


#China #USA #Germany #Ukraine #Russia #UnitedStates #EU #EU #warIn a recent report, CNN accused us of exacerbating China-US tensions. The mainstream media has also criticized China for not engaging with the US. The hypocrisy is glaring. The corporate-controlled media outlet, CNN, consistently promotes anti-China rhetoric while expecting the Chinese people to remain silent. 

The Western world claims to value free access to information, yet CNN, with its warmongering stance, seems to believe that the 1.4 billion Chinese people are incapable of forming their own opinions.

Xinjiang is a safe region, rich in diverse culture and vibrant communities. During our trip to Huocheng county in Ili, northern Xinjiang, we explored a bustling night market and engaged in conversations with Uygur, Hui, and Kazakh people. We asked them about the safety and convenience of living in and visiting Xinjiang.

Join us as we immerse ourselves in the vibrant nightscape and gain a genuine understanding of Xinjiang.

#Xinjiang #China #vlog #travel #usaWe speak with Australia-based scholars Maureen Huebel and Robert Huebel.
Maureen Huebel was attacked as being a bot, a shill, and a propagandist, after she tweeted about her plan to visit Xinjiang for her academic research next year. She did not expect the outrage and backlash she would encounter. “It looks like a pretty sophisticated attack,” Maureen told us.

We also talked about how the negative stories about Xinjiang can all be traced back to Adrian Zenz and his biased research, and how Maureen’s trip to Xinjiang will unfold with the help of Chinese universities.
#ChinaUnlocked  #NewsCorp #AdrianZenz #Australia #Xinjiang #China #povertyalleviation #USCNN correspondent Selina Wang viciously described Wuhan as the “place where the pandemic started”. The New York Times claims China provides military aid to Russia but has no evidence. How does the Western media make blatant lies without being held accountable? 

In this episode, we look into the tricks and trivia the Western media uses to make their audience believe China is evil. 

#china #usa #media #covid19 #ukraine #cnn #nytimesFollowing Tsai Ing-wen's visit to the US, China announced sanctions on "Taiwan independence" separatist Hsiao Bi-khim, and two institutions-- the Prospect Foundation and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats. What are the sanctions about? Why does China target these individuals and institutions? Let's find out. 

#taiwan #china #usaGet ready for a jaw-dropping investigation into the Nord Stream pipeline explosion that has sent shockwaves through the political world. We delve into the explosive story to uncover the truth.

As we examine the 3Ms - motive, means, and media coverage - it becomes clear that the blame game is far from over. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh's bombshell claim that US forces carried out the attack on Joe Biden's orders adds another layer of complexity to the case. 

So, join us as we sift through the evidence, follow the leads, and try to unravel this explosive mystery to find out who's really behind the Nord Stream pipeline explosion. It's a gripping tale that you won't want to miss.

Hammond noted the U.S. response made itself look “silly” in front of the world, “we went on and shot down three other completely innocent aircrafts that had nothing to do with anything. It simply was a waste of resources and just a hysterical kind of reaction.”

🌹Thank you all~U.N. human rights expert Alena Douhan says unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States and several other European countries have worsened the humanitarian situation in Syria. The Syrian people’s basic living conditions have further deteriorated in the aftermath of the earthquake while remaining sanctions scare away humanitarian actors who want to help.

Douhan said, "humanitarian organizations were not able to deliver anything besides food and medicine, and even those in very limited scope. There was no free flow. And there was no possibility to deliver any goods which couldn’t be qualified as emergency relief."

After the earthquake, the situation worsened. Many humanitarian organizations have observed a need for heavy machinery. “Unfortunately, none of that has been allowed to be delivered,” because “existing humanitarian exceptions do not provide for the possibility to deliver the necessary, lifesaving and rescue equipment.”

Facing international pressure, the U.S. Treasury Department announced a 180-day exemption on sanctions in Syria on Feb. 9th. Under “Syria General License 23,” U.S. sanctions do not target humanitarian assistance such as earthquake disaster relief efforts. But Douhan says these exceptions are “not sufficient.”
 
“It doesn’t draw a clear line between reconstruction and post-earthquake recovery,” she said. “From the experience of working within the mandate, I believe that the banks and businesses will still try to follow the zero-risk policy.”
 
There are no guarantees for humanitarian actors from sanction regimes of no punishment for delivering humanitarian aid, which could qualify as reconstruction goods. Therefore, private banks, pharmaceutical companies, and producers of critical infrastructure were scared of being fined or sanctioned, and they were hesitant to help.

Douhan said sanctions against Syria affect all aspects of human rights, from the rights to life and education to the rights of internet access and development. She said the sanctions even affect environmental rights. Especially over the past 12 years, Douhan noted that the infrastructure of the country, especially water, electricity, transportation, and communication infrastructure, had suffered severe damage, and it was impossible to provide necessary maintenance. Among a large number of internally displaced persons, there were many children born during the conflict who lost all of their relatives and didn’t know when they were born or what to do to make a living.
 
Douhan strongly urged that to provide the people of Syria with the possibility of recovery after the catastrophic earthquake, it is necessary for the U.S. and others to remove all sanctions on the quake-ravaged country to open the way for the Syrian people to rebuild basic infrastructure and allow them access to basic needs for post-quake recovery.

🌹Thank you all~It’s not true that Sri Lanka’s debt crisis was due to Chinese help, K.K. Yoganaadan, Deputy Chief of the Mission of the Sri Lankan Embassy in China, told me during a recent interview in Beijing.

“If you see our loan structure, our bilateral loan to China is about 10% of the total loan, which is very less. And then if you compare the 90% of the loan, (it) goes to multilateral agencies and to other bilateral partners,” he added.

Official data from Sri Lanka’s Finance Ministry shows China accounted for 9.77% of the country’s $35.1 billion in external debt at the end of April 2021. Japan accounted for a similar percentage of 9.69%, while the Asian Development Bank and World Bank accounted for 12.73% and 9.32% of its foreign debt, respectively. Nearly half of its external debt, 47.25%, came from market borrowings.

I was amazed by the stunning performance, known as Xinjiang Uygur Muqam (in Chinese 新疆维吾尔木卡姆), given by local Uygur singers, dancers and instrument players from the Xinjiang Art Institute.

The Muqam art – integrate songs, dances and classical music as main art form - was listed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO in 2005.

It's a must watch in Xinjiang if you ever have a chance to visit.

In the past few years, the government and environmental organizations have been exploring measures to mitigate the conflict. In 2019, Snowland Great Rivers Environmental Protection Association launched a crowdfunding campaign called "Bear-proof house." The people of Ganda Village have helped each other with local materials to build three houses to shelter from bears. How do they deal with the conflict? Find out in the series!A group of women living on Jiatang Grassland – a major natural habitat for wild animals and plants in the Sanjiangyuan area of western China – have been inspired to use their handicrafts to participate in the local community's efforts to explore the possibilities of biological conservation and sustainable development. The stuffed toys made of yak hair in miniature of key species in the region, such as the Tibetan fox, are sold online to places across China, in a bid to fund local conservation efforts including wildlife monitoring and climate change response. Watch the video to learn more.With an average altitude of 4,200 meters, Jiatang hosts large stretches of wetlands and alpine meadows. Every summer when the grassland is covered with silky, emerald coats, herders in Jiatang temporarily part from their brick houses. They round up their yaks to the summer pastures in the valleys. The hillside is adorned with cattle and sheep indulging in the aromatic grasses.Located in the source region of the Lancang River in Sanjiangyuan National Park, Angsai Township is rich in biodiversity. As a herder born and raised in Angsai, 28-year-old Sangzhou is quite familiar with nature. Before 2018, like most local herders, Sangzhou used to make ends meet through grazing and digging caterpillar fungus. Due to snowstorms and fluctuating price of the fungus, the family didn't have a stable income. So, he joined the Angsai nature experience project, bringing tourists to see wild animals and experience pastoral customs. The project brought him a sustainable income and improved his family's life.

For more:  October, the temperature in the middle and higher Qinling Mountains occasionally drops to zero degree Celsius. While most trees have lost their leaves, the bamboo forest remains green. Small animals that stroll in the woods have already hidden in their dens to embrace the coming winter, but giant pandas still perch in trees or sleep on the ground openly regardless of the unexpected snow. 

For more:  the rainy season, the weather changes rapidly in the Qinling Mountains. The animal population isn't fond of volatile weather. Raining makes it difficult to hunt for food, and being exposed to rain can cause heat loss. However, unlike their neighbors, giant pandas roam about regardless of the weather. Check the video to watch the "giant panda's version of 'Singing in the rain.'"
#nature #wildlife #documentary #journeysinnature #animal #cgtnnature #chinaIn November, autumn prevails in the Qinling Mountains. Beneath a sunny cliff, a warm scene is recorded. The cub sleeps soundly in a cave and it is time for the mother to go out eating. Without its mother by the side, the cub spends most of the day sleeping. Over two months old, it has black patterns on its body like a miniature of its mother. A panda cub's cave life usually lasts about 120 days. Will the memory of the short infancy at home linger in its mind? #nature #wildlife #documentary #environment #pandaAs autumn arrives in the Qinling Mountains, plump kiwifruits emerge and hang on the vines. Bountiful kiwifruits attract the red-billed blue magpie, who is a crazy hoarder of kiwifruits. Their hoarding habit unexpectedly helps kiwifruits to spread in the mountains. 

For more:  in the Qinling mountains spreads from the top down. All kinds of plants bend low with ripened fruits, offering a carnival for animals in the mountains. On the treetop, the unattainable wild persimmon is on the menu of the Eurasian blackcap and many other birds. On the forest floor, walnuts, chestnuts and acorns that fall from the branches lay a carpet of nuts. The snub-nosed monkeys begin their terrestrial pick-up operation as a rare yet routine exception only at this time of year.

For more:  nuts are the seeds of pines wrapped in cones. Rich in fats and other nutrients, the nuts are the monkeys' favorite snacks. From August to September, snub-nosed monkeys living in the Qinling Mountains put on a face changing show. During this period, regardless of gender, age or family name, each has a blackened mouth due to the sticky resin on the pine's foliage and cones.This giant panda leaves its scent on a tree to remind its peers that it controls that particular territory. Giant pandas are territorial animals. The special scent helps circle this stretch of land with a radius of about three kilometers as its territory. It has exclusive access to all resources here without being disturbed by its kind. When most of the bamboo is consumed, the giant panda leaves for another bamboo forest to seize a new turf. In order to avoid peer conflicts, it may have to trek for a while.The habitats for wild giant pandas have been severely fragmented due to human activities such as farmland cultivation and infrastructure construction. Researchers like Fu Mingxia in the Giant Panda National Park have been working to reconnect their habitats by building an ecological corridor.  Watch this video to learn more.When people see a giant panda, they think of bamboo. Giant pandas have been living on bamboo for millions of years. Their ancestors, however, mainly fed on meat. It's hard to imagine how they suffered from starvation before giving up on meat and choosing bamboo. Scientists have discovered some physical features of giant pandas that helped them get used to life with bamboo. 

For more:  sleep and repeat. This is the A to Z of any giant panda's existence! The giant panda isn't picky about accommodations. Whenever it feels drowsy, it can slumber anytime, anywhere. Its thick fur doubles as a mattress, fending off the damp and cold of the ground and any annoying bugs and mosquitoes. Immersed in the natural world, the giant panda dozes without care. #giantpanda #nature #wildlife #journeysinnature #documentary #cgtnnature #animalThe Qinling Mountains, which lie between northern and southern China, host bountiful bamboo. The 150 or so varieties that thrive here make up the majority of all species in China. Abundant bamboo resources fascinate the Qinling's precious fauna. The "bamboo cuisine" has not only become giant pandas' favorite dish but also attracts gourmets like the bamboo rats, snub-nosed monkeys and takins.The Daxiangling area of the Giant Panda National Park is home to three of the 33 groups of wild giant pandas. Affected by human activities for years, their habitats have been severely fragmented. The species prefers places with closed canopies and scattered bamboo. But due to deforestation, big trees with huge canopies no longer exist. Therefore, restoration and reconnection of their habitats have become priorities in conservation. What are the plans?

Proof can be found in a sentimental jazz journey from New York to Havana. Grammy-award winning pianist Arturo O'Farrill is the son of legendary Cuban musician Chico O'Farrill - who in the 1940's and 50's brought Afro-Cuban jazz to the United States.

His father never returned to Cuba after the revolution in 1959. But now that President Obama has eased restrictions on cultural exchanges between the two countries, his son Arturo has become a regular visitor, trying to rebuild bridges between Cuba and American jazz.

Our correspondent in Havana, Michael Voss, met up with Arturo O'Farrill on his most recent visit and got a backstage pass to his band's jam.

Venezuela is the country that has the world's largest reserves of crude oil, but its economy has been in dire straits -rising prices and a scarcity of food and supplies have caused public uproar.

In just the first week of 2014, more than 70 people have been murdered in barrios like this one throughout the country. The latest bout of violence has brought fresh criticism against the colectivos.

The collectivos claim however they are providing their communities with much needed security. They remain loyal to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and openly defend his revolution.
