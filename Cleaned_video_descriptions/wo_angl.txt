sanctions imposed by united states and several other european countries have worsened humanitarian situation in syria. syrian people‚Äôs basic living conditions have further deteriorated in aftermath of earthquake while remaining sanctions scare away humanitarian actors who want to help.  douhan said, "humanitarian organizations were not able to deliver anything besides food and medicine, and even those in very limited scope. there was no free flow. and there was no possibility to deliver any goods which couldn‚Äôt be qualified as emergency relief."  after earthquake, situation worsened. many humanitarian organizations have observed need for heavy machinery. ‚Äúunfortunately, none of that has been allowed to be delivered,‚Äù because ‚Äúexisting humanitarian exceptions do not provide for possibility to deliver necessary, lifesaving and rescue equipment.‚Äù  facing international pressure,  . treasury department announced 180-day exemption on sanctions in syria on feb. 9th. under ‚Äúsyria general license 23,‚Äù  . sanctions do not target humanitarian assistance such as earthquake disaster relief efforts. but douhan says these exceptions  ‚Äúnot sufficient.‚Äù   ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt draw clear line between reconstruction and post-earthquake recovery,‚Äù she said. ‚Äúfrom experience of working within mandate, i believe that banks and businesses still try to follow zero-risk policy.‚Äù   there  no guarantees for humanitarian actors from sanction regimes of no punishment for delivering humanitarian aid, which could qualify as reconstruction goods. therefore, private banks, pharmaceutical companies, and producers of critical infrastructure were scared of being fined or sanctioned, and they were hesitant to help.  douhan sanctions against syria affect all aspects of human rights, from rights to life and education to rights of internet access and development. she sanctions even affect environmental rights. especially over past 12 years, douhan noted that infrastructure of country, especially water, electricity, transportation, and communication infrastructure, had suffered severe damage, and it was impossible to provide necessary maintenance. among large number of internally displaced persons, there were many children born during conflict who lost all of their relatives and didn‚Äôt know when they were born or what to do to make living.   douhan strongly urged that to provide people of syria with possibility of recovery after catastrophic earthquake, it necessary for  . and others to remove all sanctions on quake-ravaged country to open way for syrian people to rebuild basic infrastructure and allow them access to basic needs for post-quake recovery.  #syria #turkeyearthquake2023 #earthquake #humanrights #humanitarian #usa #sanctions   if you'd
